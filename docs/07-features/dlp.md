# Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Sensitive data detection, classification, and policy enforcement across all MSERP services, managed by the Platform Service.

## Overview

Data Loss Prevention provides comprehensive protection for sensitive data across the MSERP platform. It combines automated data classification, a configurable policy engine, real-time access monitoring, and incident response workflows to prevent unauthorized data exposure, exfiltration, and misuse. DLP integrates with the Platform Service audit and notification systems to provide real-time alerting, compliance dashboards, and forensic investigation capabilities. The system supports multiple sensitive data types including PII, PHI, financial data, and intellectual property, with configurable prevention actions ranging from alerts to blocking and encryption.

## Architecture & Implementation

| Aspect | Implementation | Detail |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Data Classification Taxonomy** | Platform Service (Rust) | Hierarchical classification of sensitive data types with configurable sensitivity levels: PII (names, SSN, email, phone, address), PHI (diagnosis, medications, insurance), Financial (credit cards, bank accounts, salary), IP (trade secrets, source code, formulas) |
| **Policy Engine Architecture** | Platform Service (Rust) | Rule-based policy engine with support for conditions (data type, user role, access pattern, time, location), actions (allow, alert, block, encrypt, quarantine), and policy groups with priority |
| **Access Monitoring Patterns** | Platform Service + Auth Service | Real-time monitoring of data access patterns including volume-based (bulk download), frequency-based (repeated access), time-based (off-hours access), and anomaly-based (deviation from baseline) detection |
| **DLP Incident Workflows** | Platform Service + Workflow Engine | Automated incident creation, investigation workflow, evidence collection, remediation tracking, and resolution with escalation rules |
| **Compliance Reporting Dashboards** | Report Service | Real-time DLP compliance dashboards with incident metrics, policy effectiveness, data exposure trends, and regulatory compliance status |
| **Prevention Actions** | Platform Service | Configurable actions per policy: block (prevent access/transfer), alert (notify admin/user), encrypt (apply additional encryption), quarantine (isolate data), redact (mask in output) |

## Policy Engine Architecture

| Policy Element | Description | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **Condition** | Trigger criteria for policy evaluation | `data_type = SSN AND user.role != HR_ADMIN` |
| **Action** | Response when condition matches | `BLOCK access, ALERT security_team` |
| **Scope** | Where policy applies | `ALL services`, `Finance Service`, `API exports` |
| **Priority** | Evaluation order (higher = first) | `100` (evaluated before priority 50) |
| **Effective Period** | Time window for policy enforcement | `2025-01-01 to 2025-12-31` |
| **Exceptions** | Named exclusions from policy | `Service accounts, batch processes` |

### Prevention Actions

| Action | Effect | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **BLOCK** | Prevent the data access/transfer entirely | Unauthorized SSN export |
| **ALERT** | Send notification to security team / data owner | Unusual access pattern detected |
| **ENCRYPT** | Apply additional encryption layer on the data | Sensitive report downloaded |
| **QUARANTINE** | Move data to isolated storage pending review | Potentially compromised attachment |
| **REDACT** | Mask sensitive fields in output/reports | PII in support case export |
| **WATERMARK** | Apply tracking watermark to document | Financial report download |

## Access Monitoring Patterns

| Pattern | Detection Method | Threshold | Alert Severity |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Bulk Download | Volume-based | > 500 records in < 5 minutes | High |
| Abnormal Frequency | Frequency-based | > 10x user's baseline access rate | Medium |
| Off-Hours Access | Time-based | Access outside business hours + timezone deviation | Low |
| Anomalous Location | Geolocation-based | Access from unexpected geography | High |
| Privilege Escalation | Role-based | Access to data outside normal role scope | Critical |
| Data Staging | Pattern-based | Sequential access to sensitive records in systematic order | High |
| API Scraping | Rate-based | Structured sequential API calls suggesting data harvesting | High |
| Report Anomaly | Behavior-based | Unusual report generation (type, frequency, volume) | Medium |
